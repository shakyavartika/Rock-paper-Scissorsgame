# Rock-paper-Scissorsgame
Activity Recognition for Rock Paper Scissors
The purpose of this project was to create a real time
environment utilizing computer vision and machine
learning to play Rock Paper Scissors against
computer.
We actually train an AI that,learns to recognize hand
signs,then play its own random move
using Convolutional Neural Network for Image
Classification of rock-paper-scissors images.
Tech Stack used:Python(3.7 to 3.9
version),TensorFlow,OpenCV 4x,Keras,Scikit learn
